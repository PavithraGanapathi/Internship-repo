### âœ… Day 2: Documentation of OCR Learnings  
**Task**  
- Document insights and technical understanding gained from Day 1's OCR research  

**Insights**  
- Created a structured summary of OCR working, limitations, and techniques  
- Noted the need for preprocessing and layout analysis in high-accuracy OCR systems  
- Executed a simple Python program using PyTesseract library

### âœ… Day 3 & 4: Git and GitHub Practice  
**Task**  
- Learn and practice Git commands for version control  
- Understand repository management, branching, committing, pushing, and pull requests  

**Insights**  
- Gained hands-on experience with core Git operations such as `add`, `commit`, `branch`, and `merge`  
- Explored GitHub features like repositories, remote collaboration, and documentation through `README.md`  

---

### âœ… Day 5: Documentation of Git and GitHub  
**Task**  
- Document Day 3 & 4 insights
