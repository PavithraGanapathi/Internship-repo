## Day-wise Task and Insights

### Day 1: OCR Exploration  
**Task**:  
- Understand OCR fundamentals and explore its working principles  
- Analyze different types of answer sheets (theory, mathematical, and diagram-based) and assess how layout impacts OCR accuracy

**Insights**:  
- Learned that OCR converts scanned images to machine-readable text
- Identified challenges in recognizing handwritten content, diagrams, and equations due to layout complexity and noise

### Day 2: Documentation of OCR Learnings  
**Task**:  
- Document insights and technical understanding gained from Day 1's OCR research

**Insights**:  
- Created a structured summary of OCR working, limitations, and techniques  
- Noted the need for preprocessing and layout analysis in high-accuracy OCR systems
- Executed a simple python program using PyTesseract library

### Day 3 & 4: Git and GitHub Practice  
**Task**:  
- Learn and practice Git commands for version control  
- Understand repository management, branching, committing, pushing, and pull requests

**Insights**:  
- Gained hands-on experience with core Git operations such as `add`, `commit`, `branch`, and `merge`  
- Explored GitHub features like repositories, remote collaboration, and documentation through `README.md`

### Day 5: Documentation of Git and GitHub  
**Task**:  
- Documentation of Day 3&4 insight
- Push all content to GitHub with a clear structure and professional README

**Insights**:  
- Understood the importance of clean repository structure and project transparency  
- Compiled all work into version-controlled files and published documentation for review

### Day 6 : Introduction to Machine Learning
**Task**
- Understand the fundamentals of machine learning, its types, applications.
**Insights**
- Practiced data handling with NumPy and pandas, visualized data using matplotlib, and built an ML model using scikit-learn to classify iris flower species.
- Executed a sample machine learning program using the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.
